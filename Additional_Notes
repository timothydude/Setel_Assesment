Conceptually, this is how a proper script would work.

1. The script loads the first E-commerce website and searches for iPhone 11.
2. The script validates that the product loaded is the iPhone 11.
3. The script recursively goes through the results on the page and stores 
   website name, product name, product price and product link in a table.

4. The script loads the second E-commerce website and searches for iPhone 11.
5. The script validates that the product loaded is the iPhone 11.
6. The script recursively goes through the results on the page and stores 
   website name, product name, product price and product link in a table.
   
7. The script does a VIEW query on both tables and displays results by acsending order of product price.
